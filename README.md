Project Overview
This project looks at aviation accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), covering the years 1962 to 2023. The goal is to help our company understand the risks in the aviation industry before buying aircraft for commercial or private use.

Business Problem
Our company wants to invest in aircraft but has no background in aviation. To avoid unnecessary risk, we need to know which types of aircraft and flight situations have had the most accidents and injuries in the past.

What I Did
Cleaned and explored the dataset using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
Created visualizations to show patterns in accidents and injuries
Built a Tableau dashboard to make the findings easier to explore
Focused on:
Where most accidents happen (phase of fligh
How accident injuries have changed over the years

Key Findings
Most accidents and injuries happen during landing and takeoff
Some aircraft models appear more often in accident data, especially smaller general aviation planes
Injuries from accidents have gone down over time, showing improved safety in the industry

Recommendations
Invest in fixed-wing aircraft with strong safety records
Pay close attention to safety in landing and takeoff
Avoid experimental aircraft for now
Focus on newer aircraft, as they tend to be safer based on recent data
